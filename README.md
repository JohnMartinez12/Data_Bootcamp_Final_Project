# Data_Bootcamp_Final_Project


This project was completed by **John Zachary Martinez** in partial fulfilment of ECON-UB.0232, Data Bootcamp, Spring 2018. I certify that the NYU Stern Honor Code applies to this project. In particular, I have:

Clearly acknowledged the work and efforts of others when submitting written work as our own. The incorporation of the work of others–including but not limited to their ideas, data, creative expression, and direct quotations (which should be designated with quotation marks), or para- phrasing thereof– has been fully and appropriately referenced using notations both in the text and the bibliography.

And I understand that:
Submitting the same or substantially similar work in multiple courses, either in the same semester or in a different semester, without the express approval of all instructors is strictly forbidden.
I acknowledge that a failure to abide by NYU Stern Honor Code will result in a failing grade for the project and course.

Project Description

**This Jupyter Notebook takes a look at the evolution of LEGO since 1950, using the database of every set and part released between then and 2017. By performing, with data analysis, a precise breakdown of this evolution, we can answer questions such as: How have LEGO themes changed over time? Is LEGO getting more colorful? Are their sets increasing in complexity? LEGO is one of most popular brands of building toys on Earth, with over 100 colors and 600 themes today. It has come far from its humble beginnings of little castles and recangular prisms, so how about we take an exercise in data visualization and data manipulation to gain insight on precisely how?**
